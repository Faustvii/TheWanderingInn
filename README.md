# The Wandering Inn scraper

I have no affiliation with and no rights to The Wandering Inn; I just prefer to read on my Kindle, even without internet access.

All rights/credits and such go to pirateabe at [Wandering Inn](https://wanderinginn.com) you can read all the volumes there with better styling than the format this tool does.

I'd encourage you to buy the [official releases](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YH9X7V7/?ie=UTF8&keywords=the%20wandering%20inn&qid=1577641602&ref_=sr_1_3&sr=8-3) as they happen on Amazon to get a polished copy and [support the author](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4240617). 

This is a tool I quickly made to make a somewhat useful html page of the volumes of the Wandering Inn so I can read them on my kindle after converting them into a proper ebook format with Calibre.

I only created this project so I could continue reading on my kindle after having run out of official releases
