# The Wandering Inn

This is a tool I quickly made to make a somewhat useful html page of the volumes of the Wandering Inn so I can read them on my kindle after converting them into a proper ebook format with Calibre.

I recommend buying the actual volumes from Amazon, but sadly only two volumes were out on Amazon at the time of this.

All rights/credits and such go to pirateabe at https://wanderinginn.com you can read all the volumes there with better styling than the format this tool does.
